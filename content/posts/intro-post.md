We're getting married!! No matter what happens, we will be married on July 11th in California. With the uncertanity of regulations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic we are unsure how this wedding celebration will look. If you are reading this, you found a good spot to keep track of what will be happening as we get closer to July 11th. Also on this page (click on the little Facebook logo, or the circles icon in the top right) is a link to the Facebook event for our wedding, which will also be updated as we understand more what we will be allowed to do. So, feel free to check in with us here on our blog and we'll make sure that you know how you can celebrate with us on our big day! We love you all!
