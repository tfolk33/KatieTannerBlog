Family and friends!! Due to complications concerning the COVID-19 pandemic we have decided to be sealed in the Provo Utah Temple on June 18th! We have made this decision with the ultimate goal of being sealed for time and all eternity, an opportunity that, at the moment, is not guaranteed in California. Our reception will still be on July 11th as planned!! We are beyond excited to celebrate with all of you who feel that you are able to make it to California! More updates will follow on the specifics of that day as we learn more about what restrictions are placed on organized gathering in California. Thank you all so much!! we love you!
