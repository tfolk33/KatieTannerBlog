HEY EVERYONE! Due to increased cases of COVID-19 in the California area, we are now encouraging those that are at higher risk or families with younger children to celebrate with us through a "RECEIVING LINE PARADE" the night of our reception, July 11th, from 6:30 - 7:00pm. You will be directed through the main entrance loop (by the country barn) and be able to visit with Tanner and I through the car!! The address again for the reception is Shelley's Country Garden, 1725 Payne Ave., Brentwood CA. We appreciate everyone being flexible during these unpredictable times! Keeping everyone safe and healthy is our number one priority! Thanks for all of the love and support!
