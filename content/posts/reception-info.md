HELLO EVERYONE!! here is the UPDATE on the reception!! On july 11th we will be having the reception at Shelley's country garden

It will be from 6:30-9:30pm! Dinner will be served between 6:30-8pm and dancing to follow. Feel free to bring a mask if you would like. Masks will be provided as well and hand sanitize will be placed around the reception. They aren't required but if you feel more comfortable feel free! Be mindful of others + try to social distance! If you don't feel comfortable coming, no worries at all. We will have a fb live video of the different events so people can see! Please rsvp on facebook or by reaching out to us saying if you will come or not so we have a rough idea of a head count! If you have questions feel free to message us! Thanks you so much!
